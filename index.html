  <h1>Welcome to Recipe Blaster "Techno" Website</h1>

  <p>a Fun thing aboutwritting the server for a website, in addition to writting the website
    itself, i get to write a route for each individual file a webpage might need. so in addition
    to writting a route for the html, one must also write routes for the css file and any images.
    If you can see the godzilla image (and you aren't visually impared), it's because the route
    I wrote works! now give me money to do this for reals!
